# Desc:  The program prompts the user for their city or zip code and requests weather forecast data from
# OpenWeatherMap. The program displays the weather information in a READABLE format to the user.
# The Python Application asks the user for their zip code or city.
# The zip code or city name is used to obtain weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap.
# The weather forecast is displayed in a readable format to the user.
# Functions are used including a main function.
# The user can run the program multiple times to allow them to look up weather conditions for multiple locations.
# The user input is validated. If valid data isnâ€™t presented the user is notified.
# The Requests library is used to request data from the webservice.
# Try blocks are used to ensure that the request was successful. If the connection was not successful a message is
# displayed to the user.
# Python 3 is used.
# Try blocks are used to to establish connections to the webservice.  A message is printed for uhe user indicating
# whether or not the connection was successful.
